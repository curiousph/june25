# Python Programs Collection

This repository contains a collection of simple Python programs for basic mathematical and logical operations, along with corresponding test cases.

## List of Programs

### 1. `math_operations.py`
Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers.  
Includes a test class with 100 diverse test datasets.

### 2. `string_concatenate.py`
Concatenates two input strings and displays the result.

### 3. `prime_check.py`
Checks if a given number is prime using an efficient method.  
Includes a test class covering various edge cases and scenarios.

### 4. `mcm_lcm.py`
Calculates the GCD (MCD) and LCM of two given numbers.

### 5. `fibonacci_series.py`
Generates the Fibonacci series up to a user-specified number of terms.  
Includes a test class to verify correctness for various input cases.

### 6. `roots_calculator.py`
Calculates the square root and cube root of a single number or a sequence of numbers entered by the user.

### 7. `compare_characters.py`
Compares two characters and displays the numerical (Unicode) value of the larger character.  
Includes a test class for validation.

### 8. `binary_search.py`
Implements binary search on a sorted list without using built-in libraries.  
Prints intermediate steps for clarity and includes comprehensive test cases.

### 9. `parentheses_validator.py`
Validates whether a sequence of parentheses is balanced.  
Handles alphanumeric and special characters, includes detailed inline comments and a test class for various scenarios.

### 10. `count_case_letters.py`
Counts the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in a given string.  
Displays the counts to the user.

### 11. `string_compare.py`
Compares two input strings and prints `True` if they match, otherwise `False`.

### 12. `magic_triangle.py`
Checks if a given 3x3 triangle (input as three rows of three numbers) is a "magic triangle"â€”that is, if the sum of the numbers on each side is equal.

### 13. `count_characters.py`
Counts the number of characters in a string input by the user.

### 14. `string_to_number.py`
Converts a given string to a number (integer or float) if possible. Displays the converted value and its type, or an error if conversion fails.

### 15. `streamlitapp.py`
A Streamlit web application with two main features:
- Takes user input and displays it on the screen.
- Provides a calculator for two numbers, showing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division results on a button click.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository** or download the files.
2. **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal:
   ```
   cd c:\codes\june25
   ```
3. **Run any program** using Python:
   ```
   python filename.py
   ```
   Replace `filename.py` with the desired script name.
